--> Binary trees are the different data structures allows hierarchial organization and structure of multi-level sequences.
~ Binary Tree :- it is a fundamental heirarchial data structure that comprises nodes are arranged in a tree like structure.
                 It consists of nodes, where each node can have atmost 2 child nodes termed as left child and right child.

~ Node :- Each node in a tree contains a peice of data.Often referred as node's value or key
          This node also contains references and pointers to its left and right children So 
         that we can traverse from one node to another in a hierarchial order.
~ Root Node:- The top most node of a binary tree is called the root node for a tree.
~ Children nodes are the nodes which are directly connected to its parent node.
~ Leaf Node:- The nodes which are not having any children.
------------------------------------------------------------------Types of binary trees--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~ Full Binary Tree :- It is a strict binary tree where each node must contain 0 or 2 children.
~ Complete Binary Tree :- it is a specialized binary tree where all the levels of the tree except last level must be fully
                        filled, If the last level is not completely filled, it is filled from left to right, ensuring that nodes are positioned as far left as possible.
~ Perfect Binary Tree :- it is also a binary tree where it must contain either 0 or 2 children only.
                        And the level of all the leaf nodes of the tree must be same. And the number of leaf nodes is maximize for that level.
~ Balanced Binary Tree :- A Balanced Binary tree is a type of Binary Tree where the heights of the two subtrees of any node differ by at most one. 
                        This property ensures that the tree remains relatively well-balanced, preventing the tree from becoming highly skewed or degenerate.
~ Degenerate Binary Tree :- A Degenerate Tree is a Binary Tree where the nodes are arranged in a single path leaning to the right or left. 
                        The tree resembles a linked list in its structure where each node points to the next node in a linear fashion.
